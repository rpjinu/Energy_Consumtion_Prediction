- **Energy Prediction Model**: Uses machine learning algorithms to forecast energy consumption.
- **Appliance-Level Analysis**: Provides detailed consumption data for individual appliances.
- **Visualization**: Displays energy usage graphs and predictive trends.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed for both residential and commercial applications.

## Dataset
- Includes data from various household appliances.
- Features include timestamp, appliance type, energy usage, and environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
- **Framework**: Flask/Streamlit (optional for deployment)
